# InfoSec Concepts Demonstrator

This project is a simple, interactive web application built with Flask to demonstrate and explain four fundamental concepts in information security: **Plaintext**, **Encoding**, **Hashing**, and **Encryption**.

The application provides a hands-on way to see the difference between these concepts by allowing users to input their own text and see the output in real-time.

## Core Concepts Covered

This tool is based on the clear distinctions between different data handling methods:

1.  **Plaintext (No Protection):** Raw, readable data that is vulnerable to interception.
2.  **Encoding (2-Way, Not for Security):** A reversible process to convert data into a different format for usability or transmission (e.g., Base64). It is **not** a security measure.
3.  **Hashing (1-Way Protection):** An irreversible process that transforms data into a fixed-size hash. Used to verify data integrity and authenticity, not for confidentiality.
4.  **Encryption (2-Way Protection):** A secure, reversible process that converts data into unreadable ciphertext using a key. It ensures confidentiality and can only be reversed with the correct key.

## Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** Python with the Flask framework.
*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (using a modern Flexbox layout).
*   **Core Python Libraries:**
    *   `base64` for encoding.
    *   `hashlib` for hashing.
    *   `cryptography` for secure encryption.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can check by running:
```bash
python --version
```

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine (or simply create the project folder).

### 2. Set Up the Project Structure

Organize your project with the following folder structure:

```
infosec_tool/
├── app.py              # Main Flask application file
├── README.md           # This file!
├── static/
│   └── style.css       # All CSS styles
└── templates/
    └── layout.html     # The base HTML template
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

This project requires the Flask library. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install it using pip:

```bash
pip install Flask
```
*(We will add `cryptography` here later when we implement the encryption part.)*

### 4. Run the Application

With the files in place and dependencies installed, run the Flask application from your terminal:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will start in debug mode, which means it will automatically reload whenever you save a file. You will see a message like this:

```
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

### 5. View in Your Browser

Open your favorite web browser and navigate to the URL provided:

[**http://127.0.0.1:5000**](http://127.0.0.1:5000 )

You should now see the application running!

## AI Transparency

This project was developed in collaboration with **Manus**, an AI assistant. The core logic, code structure, design iterations, and documentation were co-created through a guided, conversational process.

*   **Initial Concept & Goal:** Provided by Thiago.
*   **Code Generation & Refinement:** Provided by Manus.
*   **Design & Layout:** Jointly iterated by Thiago and Manus.
*   **Documentation:** Generated by Manus based on the development steps.
